        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The cemetery was started in 1852 by three churches located near the cemetery, two of which have long since moved on or disbanded. The third church is adjacent to the cemetery.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Hurricane Cemetery does not sell its grave sites. It maintains no perpetual care fund. It engages in no sales of monuments, flowers or other services or products related to cemetery activities.  The cemetery relies on individual donations from family members of those interred in the cemetery as well as friends of the cemetery to provide the necessary funds to maintain the cemetery and an annual fundraiser which consists of an event selling chicken stew to the general public. To date, maintenance means keeping the grass mowed in the summer and the leaves collected in the fall.  The Cemetery is available to anyone who seeks to be buried there.
